> ## The Problems and How I Deal With It

This is my biggest project with a lot of new technologies for me.

BZ Publish system was designed for can manage various clients needs. like multiple role access, multiple site, multiple language, and many more. but always be chalanging for me is handling multiple language,  every CRUD Proses i should create form with function for handle this case. i learn a lot from this. every day during i working this project always fight with form validation, handling array, handling http request. very intresting fight for me .
